# Investigate-A-Dataset
## Analyze TMDB movies dataset using Numpy and Pandas and communicate the findings in a report

We selected the TMBD movie dataset to analyze for this project. The TMDB movies datset contains data of about 0000+ movies and has 
attributes like budget, revenue, vote count, genres, production companies, etc. Some attributes have multiple values per row in the 
dataset. 

Based on the data, we present some questions which might be of interest to us. These are called Exploratory questions. We observe the data 
and clean the data as needed to remove duplicates, save the correct datatypes, etc.

Once the data has been cleaned, we megin exploring the data based on our questions. We use visualizations and graphs to obtains answers to the 
exploratory questions which we posed at the beginning of the project. Once we find answers to those questions, we present our findings in 
the form of a report at the end of the project

## Installation:

We need a functional Jupyter notebook to view the code and the following libraries installed:

Numpy
Pandas

These can be installed using pip or conda.
